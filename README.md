# 📦 slack-bot

## Project Overview
The **slack-bot** repository hosts a Slack bot built with **Go** that integrates with the Slack API to handle various user commands. Designed as a JavaScript project, this bot is intended to enhance user interactions within Slack channels. It’s a versatile tool for automating responses and managing user requests seamlessly.

## 🌟 Features
- **Dynamic Command Handling:** The bot can respond to user inputs dynamically using predefined commands.
- **Environment Variable Support:** Configuration settings are managed through environment variables for enhanced security.
- **Simple Setup:** Quick installation steps enable rapid deployment of the bot.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Users receive instant replies based on their input.

## 📦 Installation
To get started with the Slack bot, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- ✅ Go (version 1.22.1 or higher)
- ✅ Git

Follow these steps to install and configure the bot:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/slack-bot.git
   ```

2. Navigate into your cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd slack-bot
   ```

3. Install Go dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

4. Build the application:
   ```bash
   go build
   ```

5. Create a `.env` file in your root directory and populate it with your configuration:
    ```
    SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
    SLACK_APP_TOKEN=your_app_token_here
    PORT=3000 # optional, change if needed 
    NODE_ENV=development # optional, indicates environment type 
    ```
    
6. Start the bot by executing the compiled binary:
   ```bash
   ./slack-bot
   ```

## 💻 Usage
Once set up, simply run your executable file, and your Slack bot will be operational! You can interact with it in any designated Slack channel using defined commands.

Example command: 
```
My Yob is 1990  
```
This will return your calculated age!
